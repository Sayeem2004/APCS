Task #1: The integer data type int.
==============================================================================

 1. From : https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/12types/

    read about the Java Integers

 2. When both operands of a binary operator are int's then the answer
    will be an integer. With the division operator, /, the integer
    result is obtain by discarding the decimal fraction. The operation
    of discarding a decimal fraction is called truncation.

 Question #1: Calculate the result of each of the following expressions:

     a. 6 + 5 / 4 - 3




     b. 2 + 2 * (2 * 2 - 2) % 2 / 2


     c.  10 + 9  * (8 + 7 % 6) + 5 * 4 % 3 * 2 + 1


     d. 1 + 2 + (3 + 4) * (( 5 * 6 % 7 * 8) - 9 ) - 10




 Question #2 : From the book site, review and discuss exercises 1 and 7

               d. System.out.println("bc" + (2 + 3));



               e. System.out.println("bc" + 2 + 3);





 Question #3: An integer constant is ordinarily written as a string of
              decimal digits. If the number begins with 0, however, the
	      compiler interprets the value in base 8, which is called an
	      octal.

              Consider the statement:

                     int x = 040;

              What is the decimal value of x?




Question #4:  If you prefix a numeric constant with the characters 0x,
              the compiler interprets that number in base 16, or
	      hexadecimal.

              Consider the statement:

                     int n = 0xFF;

              What is the decimal value for n?



===============================================================================
Task #2: Library Methods From Integer.
===============================================================================

- Java provides library methods to convert the strings we type as command-
  line arguments into numeric values for primitive types.

    The Method:

     Integer.parseInt(String) -> int


     For example,

          Integer.parseInt("123") -> 123


Java provides online documentation for its libraries and classes.
This documentation is known as an Application Programming Interface, API.

Review the Java 11 API for the Integer class.

  https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Integer.html



Question #5: From the book site review and run the IntOps.java program. What happens
             when you attempt to divide by zero?




Question #6: How would you use the Integer library in your source code to retrieve
             the maximum value of an int.




==============================================================================
Task #3: The other integer data types.
==============================================================================


Like all data, values of type int are stored internally in storage units
that have a limited capacity. Those values therefore have a maximum size,
which limits the range of integers you can use. To get around this problem,
Java defines four integer types - byte, short, int and long - distinguished
from each other by the size of their domains.

     Type      	  Domain
     byte         8 - bit integers in the range -128 to 127
     short       16 - bit integers in the range -32768 to 32767
     int         32 - bit integers in the range -2147483648 to 2147483647
     long        62 - bit integers in the range -9223372036854775808 to
      		      	  	      	  	 9223372036854775807

The AP exam only tests your knowlege of the int data type.

To create a long literal place an L at the end of the sequence of digits.

    ex. long phone = 5558415267L;



If the int results that we get from arithmetic operations are too large to
fit into int's 32-bit representation, then an overflow occurs.


Question #7: Suppose that a variables max and min are declared as:
                 int max  = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
		 int min  = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

             What does each of the following print?

        a. System.out.println("max =  " + max);
	b. System.out.println("min = "  + min);
	c. System.out.println("max + 1 = " + (max + 1));
	d. System.out.println("min - 1 = " + (min - 1));
	e. System.out.println("-2 - max = " + (-2 - max));
	f. System.out.println("2 * max = " + (2 * max));
	g. System.out.println("4 * max = " + (4 * max));
	h. System.out.println("-min = "  + -min);


======================================================================
Task #4: Practice
======================================================================
I. What will be the result of attempting to compile and run the following
   class?

    public class Integers{

             public static void main(String args[]){
	     	    System.out.println(0x10 + 10 + 010);
             }
    }

II. What is the value of evaluating this expression:

             - -1-3 * 10 / 5 - 1

    Select the one right answer.
    (a) -8
    (b) -6
    (c) 7
    (d) 8
    (e) 10
    (f) None of the above

III. Which of the following statements are true?

     Select all valid answers.
     (a) The result of the expression (1 + 2 + "3") would be the string "33".
     (b) The result of the expression ("1" + 2 + 3) would be the string "15".
     (c) The result of the expression (10/9) would be the int value 1.

IV. From the book site : 1.2 Built-In Data Types

     Look in the Java 11 Math API for the Math library. Read about Math.max() and Math.min().

     Complete Exercise # 34 ThreeSort.java. Check your work with the posted program.

V. Complete the following Web Exercises:

    # 1 Swap.java
    # 6
    #14
