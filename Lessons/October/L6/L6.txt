Task #1: Previous Lesson
===========================================================================

 Question #1:
         Evaluate these expressions then use DoubleOps.java to check you work




        a. 0.1 + 0.1
	b. 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
        c. -0.0 / 3.0
        d.  1.0 / 0.0
        e. Math.sqrt(-2)
	f. Math.round(6.022e23)

	   long Math.round(double)



 Question #2:

  Indicate the values and types of the following expressions:

   a. 2 + 3
   b. 19 / 5
   c. 19.0 / 5
   d. 3 * 6.0
   e. 19 % 5
   f. 2 % 7



Question #3:
              Evaluate the following code segments and explain the result.

            (a). int n = Math.PI;
                       = double





            (b). int n = (int) Math.PI;



Question #4:

    From the book site https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/12types/
    read the secion on type conversion.
    Download and run the program RandomInt.java.

    Modify RandomInt to take two command-line arguments a and b, then
    print a uniform random integer within [a,b).


    double r = Math.random();   // r is within [0,1)
    int value =   ?              // value is with [a, b)







Question #5: From the book site complete exercise 5. (Construct a truth table for
             the ^ operator).

             A   |  B  |  A ^ B
	    --------------------








Question #6: Suppose that an and b are boolean variables. Show that the expression:

     (!(a && b) && (a || b)) || ((a && b) || !(a || b)) evaluates to true.


     DeMorgan's Law
        not(A or B) = not A and not B
	not(A and B) = not A or not B









Question #7: Give the value of the variable a after the execution of each of the following
             sequence of statements:

              boolean a = true;
	      a = !a;
	      a = !a;
	      a = !a;




Question #8:
          Complete exercise 4 from the book site.

Question #9:
           Complete web exercise #2.

Question #10:
     Complete web exercise #7.


Question #11:
     Given:
             int x = 4;
	     double y = 2.5;
	     boolean a = false;
             a = ( x = 2) == (int) y;


     Determine the values of the variables x, y and a.





=============================================================================
Task #2: Ternary Operator: ?:
=============================================================================
--- The Java programming language includes another Boolean operator called ?:
    that can be extremely useful in certain situations. In programming parlance,
    the name of this operator is always pronouned as question-mark colon, even
    though the two characters do not appear adjacent to each other in the code.
    Unlike the other operators in Java, ?: is written in two parts and requires
    three operands. The general form of the operation is

           (condition) ? exp1 : exp2

    The parentheses are not technically required, but Java programmers often
    include them to emphasize the boundaries of the conditional test.

    When a Java program encounters the ?: operator, it first evaluates the
    condition. If the condition turns out be be true, exp1 is evaluated and
    used as the value of the entire expression; if the condition is false, the
    value is the result of evaluating exp2. For example, you can use the ?:
    operator to assign to max either the value of x or the value of y, whichever
    is greater, as follows:

         max = ( x > y) ? x : y;


Question #1:
	 Given:

	        boolean isLeapYear = false;
		int daysInFebruary = (isLeapYear) ? 29 : 28;


	 Determine the value of daysInFebruary.



========================================================================================
Task #3: The Assignment Operator
========================================================================================
      Forms :     name = expression
                  name op= expression

   * op= : is either : +=, -=, /=, %=, *=

        x -= k
	x = x - k

   * Java allows assignment statements to convert the value on
     the right hand side so that it matches the declared type
     of the variable as long as the conversion involves no loss
     of accuracy.



 Consder the code:

          int y = 2.54;

       This statement will cause a compiler error because
       of the potential loss of data via truncation.

       However,

          int y  = (int) 2.54;   // q

       is a valid statement. The double 2.54 converts to the int 2,
       then y is assigned 2.

--- Embedded Assignment Example

  Question #2:

     Evaluate this code.

      int x = 0;
      int y = 0;
      int z = (x = 6) + (y = 7);


      What are the values of x, y and z?




--- Multiple Assignment Example

 Question #3:

   Given:
   	  int a,b,c;
   	  a = b = c = 5;


   (a) What are the values of a, b, and c?






   (b) Is the = operator left or right associative?







---  Shorthand assignments

   variable op= expression;  is equivalent to

   variable = variable op expression;


  Question #4:

    Given:
    	   int x = 20;
    	   int y = 50;
    	   x /= 2;
    	   y -= 3;

    What are the values of x and y?




=======================================================================================
Task #4:INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATORS : ++ and --
=======================================================================================

--- Adding 1 to a variable is called incrementing( denoted by ++).
--- Subtracting 1 from a variable is call decrementing (denoted by --).


       x++ is equivalent to x += 1 thus equivalent to x = x + 1;.
       y-- is equivalent to y -= 1 thus equivalent to y = y - 1;.



-- Two ways to increment or decrement

      x++   is the suffix form (or post increment)
      ++x   is the prefix form

      x++   Evaluates to the value of x first, and then increments x. The
      	    value returned to the location is the value of x before incrementing
      	    it.

      ++x   Increments the value of x first, then returns the new value to
       	    the locaton of ++x.

      x--, --x works similarly.

 Question #5:
   	  Given:

		int a = 3;
    	  	int b = a++;

	   What are the values of a and b?




 Question #6:

 	  Given :
     	  	int a = 3;
     		int b = ++a;

          What are the values of a and b?




 Question #7:

 	  Given :

    	  	int a = 10;
    		int b = 20;
    		int c = (a++) - (b *= 2);

  	   What are the values of a,b and c?




  Question #8: (web exercise #44).

          What is the value of i after the following confusing code is executed?

                 int i = 10;
		 i = i++;
		 i = ++i;
		 i = i++ + ++i

          Moral: don't write code like this.




=========================================================================================
Task #5: Statements
=========================================================================================
  -- section 1.3 Conditionals and loops

--- Two Types of Statements:

     1. Simple statements - perform some action.

     2. Control statements - affect the way other statements are executed.


 -- Simple statements

         expression;

      - The expression must be:
            -  a method call
	    -  an assignment
	    -  an invocation of the increment  or decrement operator
	    -  a declaration


 -- Blocks
         -  used with control statements.
         - aka. compound statements
         - are a sequence of statements enclosed in {}.


         {
           statement0;
           .
           .
           .
           statementN;
         }

   *** The Java compiler treates a block as a single statement.

 -- The if statement

    -  A control statement that uses conditional execution.


    Form:
         if (condition) statement

         if (condition) statement else statement

         - condition must be a boolean value.
         - parentheses are required.

 -- Example : Determine if a number is even of odd.

    	    if (n % 2 == 0){
               System.out.println("even");
   	    }
   	    else{
	       System.out.println("odd");
            }

======================================================================================
Task #6:  Homework:
         -- submit your solutions to 7 and 8 listed below.
	 -- File names to submit must be :
	         Distinct.java
		 RGBTOCMYK.java
	 -- Include documentation in your source code.
	 -- Remove any package declarations.

======================================================================================

1. Review the documentation for Java operators :

     https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html

2. Read section 1.3 : Conditionals and Loops at least up to the if statement.

3. Review the code Flip.java from section 1.3.

4. Watch Lecture 2A: Conditionals the if statement

5. From section 1.3: try exercise 1. (AllEqual.java).

6. From section 1.3: try exercise 6. (RollLoadedDie.java).

7. Write a program, Distinct.java, that takes three integer command-line arguments
   a, b, and c and print the number of distinct values (1, 2, or 3) among a, b, and c.

8. Practice Type conversion.

   There are a number of different formats for representing color.
   RGB format specifies the level of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) on an integer scale
   from 0 to 255: It is the primary format for LCD displays, digital cameras, and web pages.

   CMYK format specifies the level of cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K) on a
   real scale of 0.0 to 1.0: It is the primary format for publishing books and magazines.
   Write a program RGBtoCMYK.java that reads in three integers red, green, and blue from the
   command line and prints out equivalent CMYK parameters. The mathematical formulas for
   converting from RGB to an equivalent CMYK color are:

       white = max{red/255, green/255, blue/255}
       cyan  = (white - red/255) / white
       magenta = (white - green/255) / white
       yellow = (white - blue/255) / white
       black = (1 - white)

   Hint. Math.max(x, y) returns the maximum of x and y.

    % java RGBtoCMYK 75 0 130       // indigo
      cyan    = 0.423076923076923
      magenta = 1.0
      yellow  = 0.0
      black   = 0.4901960784313726

    If all three red, green, and blue values are 0, the resulting color is black (0 0 0 1).
