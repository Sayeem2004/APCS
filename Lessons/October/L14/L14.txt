1. Review the program Sample.java that demonstrates how to take a
   sample without replacement from an array.


2. Consider the code:

        String [] suits = {"clubs", "diamonds", "hearts", "spades" };
        String [] ranks = {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7" , "8",
                           "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King" , "Ace"};

        String [] deck = new String[52];
        int k = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < suits.length; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < ranks.length; j++)
                deck[k++] = ranks[j] + "\tof " + suits[i];


   Write code to simulate printing a random 5 card poker hand. You
   many not alter the order of the deck[].

     	// PRESERVE THE ORDER OF THE DECK





3. Write a program that takes an integer command-line argument n, generates
   a random permutation of the integers from [0,n), prints the permutation,
   and prints the number of left-to-right minima in the permuation
   (the number of times an element is the smallest seen so far).


   Your program name must be named: Minima.java
   Compilation instuctions must be: $javac Minama.java
   Execution instruction must be :  $java Minama  n
   Your name must appear in the documentation.



   $java Minama 2
    0 1
    left-to-right minima: 1

   $java Minama 2
    1 0
    left-to-right minima: 2


    $java Minama 3
     0 1 2
     left-to-right minima: 1

    $java Minama 3
     1 0 2
     left-to-right minima: 2


    $java Minama 5
     4 3 1 0 2
     left-to-right minima: 4

     $java Minima 5
      3 4 2 0 1
      left-to-right minima: 3


4. Alice is throwing a party with n other guests, including
   Bob. Bob starts a rumor about Alice by telling it to one of the other
   guests. A person hearing this rumor for the first time will immediately
   tell it ot one other guest, chosen uniformly at random from all the
   people at the party except Alice and the person from whom they heard it.
   If a person (including Bob) hears the rumor for a second time, he or she
   will not propagate it further. Write a program to estimate the probability
   that everyone at the party (except Alice) will hear the rumor before it
   stops propagating. Also calculate an estimate of the expected number
   of people to hear the rumor.


   Your program name must be named: Rumors.java
   Compilation instuctions must be: $javac Rumors.java
   Execution instruction must be :  $java Rumors  n  trials
     n is the number of guests
     trials is the number of trials performed.
   Your name must appear in the documentation.

   $ java Rumors 1 100
     P(all heard) : 1.0
     expect number of people who heard rumor: 1.0

   $ java Rumors 2 100
     P(all heard): 1.0
     expect number of people who heard rumor: 2.0


   $ java Rumors 3 100
     P(all heard): 1.0
     expect number of people who heard rumor: 3.0

   $ java Rumors 4 100000
     P(all heard): 0.50072
     expect number of people who heard rumor: 3.50072


   $ java Rumors 5 100000
     P(all heard): 0.2254
     expect number of people who heard rumor: 3.8966
