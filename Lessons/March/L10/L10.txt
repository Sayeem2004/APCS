Task #2: GPA.java - Group Work
========================================================================
Write a Map client GPA.java that creates a symbol table mapping letter
grades to numerical scores, as in the table below, and then reads from
standard input a list of letter grades and computes their average (GPA).

     A+   A    A-   B+   B    B-   C+   C    C-   D    F
    4.33 4.00 3.67 3.33 3.00 2.67 2.33 2.00 1.67 1.00 0.00














========================================================================
Task#3: FrequencyTable.java - Group Work
========================================================================

Write a program,FrequencyTable.java, that displays a table showing the
number of words that appear in the English lexicon, sorted by length of
the word.

Your program must use a Map and process the words found here:

Task #4: ScrabbleShooks.java - Group Work
========================================================================

One of the most important stategic principles in Scrabble is to conserve
your S tiles, because the rules for English plurals mean that many words
take on S-hook at the end. Some words, of course, allow an S tile to be
added at the beginning, but it turns out that there are words --including
for example, both the words "cold" and "hot" -- that allow S-hooks on
either end. Write a program that uses the Scrabble dictionary to make
a list of all such words.

=========================================================================
Task #5: RandomPhoneNumbers.java - Individual Work
=========================================================================

Write a program that takes a command line input N and prints N random
phone numbers of the form (xxx) xxx-xxxx. Use a symbol table to avoid
choosing the same number more than once.

Use this list of area codes

   https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/data/phone-na.csv

to avoid printing out bogus area codes.












===========================================================================
Task #6: UniqueSubstringsOfLengthL.java - Individual Work
===========================================================================
Write a program that reads in text from standard input and calculate the
number of unique substrings of length L that it contains. For example, if
the input is cgcgggcgcg then there are 5 unique substrings of length 3:
            cgc, cgg, gcg, ggc, and ggg.

Applications to data compression.

Hint: use the string method substring(i, i + L) to extract ith substring
and insert into an appropriate collection.
Test it out on the first million digits of pi

or 10 million digits of pi
