Time Complexity Of Edit Distance:
  The estimated order of growth for the EditDistance.java program is O(N^2) because it has a double nested
  for loop with lengths N and M. This means the program runs in O(NM) which is generalized to O(N^2).

Space Complexity Of Edit Distance:
  The estimated space complexity for the EditDistance.java program is O(N^2) because the most significant
  space required is a 2d array with lengths of N and M. This means the program uses approximately O(NM)
  space which is generalized to O(N^2).
