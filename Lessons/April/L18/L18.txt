AP REVIEW : Unit 3 - FREE RESPONSE
===========================================================================
Question 1
Item 1
Question 1

SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA.

    Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.
    Unless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and
    that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.
    In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed
    in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a
    call to one of these methods will not receive full credit.



Assume that the following variables have been properly declared and initialized.

    a boolean variable named rsvp
    an int variable named selection, where 1 represents "beef", 2 represents "chicken", 3 represents "pasta",
                                     and all other values represent "fish"
    a String variable named option1
    a String variable named option2

(a)   Write a code segment that prints "attending" if rsvp is true and
      prints "not attending" otherwise.

      Write the code segment below.


     // *********  ANSWER ********************
     if (rsvp) System.out.println("attending");
     else      System.out.println("not attending");



Question 2

(b)   Write a code segment that prints the food item associated with selection. For example, if selection is 3,
      the code segment should print "pasta".

      Write the code segment below. Your code segment should meet all specifications and conform to the example.


       // ***** ANSWER ******************************
       if (selection == 1) System.out.println("beef");
       else if (selection == 2) System.out.println("chicken");
       else if (selection == 3) System.out.println("pasta");
       else System.out.println("fish");




(c)   Write a code segment that will store a dinner selection in option1 based on the values of rsvp and
      selection. The intended behavior of the code segment is described below.

      If rsvp is true, the code segment should store in option1 a string indicating the person’s attendance
      and food choice. For example, if rsvp is true and selection is 1, the following string should be stored in option1.

      "Thanks for attending. You will be served beef."

      If rsvp is false, the following string should be stored in option1, regardless of the value of selection.

      "Sorry you can't make it."

      Write the code segment below. Your code segment should meet all specifications and conform to the examples.



       // ***** ANSWER ******************************
       if (rsvp){
          option1 = "Thanks for attending. You will be served ";
	  if (selection == 1) option1 += "beef.";
	  else if (selection == 2) option1 += "chicken.";
	  else if (selection == 3) option1 += "pasta.";
	  else option1 += "beef.";

	  }
       else{
          option1 = "Sorry you can't make it.";
       }



(d)   Write a code segment that will print true if the strings option1 and option2 contain the same values and will
      print false otherwise.

      Write the code segment below.



      // *********** ANSWER **************
      System.out.println(option1.equals(option2));

Question 2
Item 2

SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA.

    Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.
    Unless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and
    that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.
    In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed
    in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by
    a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit.


    This question involves the Draw class, which is used to draw line segments and squares on a
    10-by-10 xy-coordinate grid.

public class Draw{

/** Precondition: All parameters are between 0 and 10, inclusive.
* Draws a line segment in a 10-by-10 xy-coordinate grid.
* The line segment is drawn from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).
*/

public void drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
{ /* implementation not shown */ }



/** Precondition: 0 ≤ x < 10, 0 < y ≤ 10, and len > 0.
 * Draws a square on a 10-by-10 xy-coordinate grid
 * and prints the square’s side length and area.
 * The upper left corner of the square will be located
 * at the coordinate (x, y) and the side length of the
 * square will be len (or as large as will fit in the grid).
 */

public void drawSquare(int x, int y, int len)
{ /* to be implemented */ }

}

The drawLine method, whose implementation is not shown, is used to draw a line segment from
the coordinate (x1, y1) to the coordinate (x2, y2). For example, the call drawLine(2, 5, 6, 4)
will produce the figure below. The figure presents a line segment in the x y coordinate plane.
The numbers 0 through 10, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis, and the numbers 0 through 10,
in increments of 1, are indicated on the y axis. One endpoint of the line segment is the point with
coordinates 2 comma 5, and the other endpoint of the line segment is the point with coordinates 6 comma 4.


You will write method drawSquare, which draws a square on a 10-by-10 grid and prints the square’s side length
and area in the format shown in the examples. The upper left corner of the square is located at the coordinate (x, y).
The sides of the square will be of length len, or as large as will fit on the grid.

The following examples show the intended behavior of drawSquare.

Example 1

The call drawSquare(1, 4, 3) will produce the figure below. The upper left corner of the square is at the coordinate
(1, 4) and the square has sides of length 3.

The call will print "side length = 3, area = 9".



Write the method drawSquare below.

/** Precondition: 0 ≤ x < 10, 0 < y ≤ 10, and len > 0.
 * Draws a square on a 10-by-10 xy-coordinate grid
 * and prints the square’s side length and area.
 * The upper left corner of the square will be located
 * at the coordinate (x, y) and the side length of the
 * square will be len (or as large as will fit in the grid).
 */

public void drawSquare(int x, int y, int len)
