=====================================================================
Task #1: AP REVIEW : Unit Test 4 free response.
=====================================================================
 Go over question 1.


====================================================================
Task #2: Doubling Hypothesis Reveiw
====================================================================
Suppose the running time of an algorithm on inputs of size 1,000,
2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 is 5 seconds, 20 seconds, 45 seconds, and
80 seconds, respectively. Is the order of growth of the running time
linear, linearithmic, quadratic, cubic, or exponential?


====================================================================
Task #3:  Order of Growth using Mathematical Analysis
====================================================================

Conisider the ThreeSum.java program.

If you run this program, you will find that the elapsed time increases
by about a factor of 8 to print each line. This leads immediately to
the hypothesis that the running time increases by a factor of 8 when
the input size doubles.

Suggesting the hypothesis that the running time satisfies a power law
of the form cn^3.

  // return number of distinct triples (i, j, k)
  // such that a[i] + a[j] + a[k] = 0
    public static int count(int[] a) {
        int n = a.length;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
                for (int k = j+1; k < n; k++) {
                    if (a[i] + a[j] + a[k] == 0) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }


Mathematical analysis.
The total running time is determined by two primary factors:

    * The cost of executing each statement.
    * The frequency of execution of each statement.

The if statement in the innermost loop executes n choose 3 times

  n!         n(n-1)(n-2)
---------  = ----------- = n^3/6 - n^2/2 + n/3
 3!(n-3)!       6

===========================================================================
Task#4: Assignment-29: Asymptotic Equivalence (Tilde Notation)
===========================================================================
1. Watch the first 2 minutes of the video:

   MIT VIDEO ASYMPTOTIC NOTATION:
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWkh5kb4TGc


2. From the book site, read the explanation of why

     n^3/6 - n^2/2 + n/3 ~ n^3/6


3. Use the tilde notation to simplify

   a.  n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)/24
   b.  n(n+1) - n^2
   c.  n(n+1)/2 + nlog n
       Hint:
       https://socratic.org/questions/how-do-you-find-the-limit-of-ln-n-n-as-n-approaches-infinity

4. Watch minutes 5:15 - 6:45 of the MIT video.

5. From the book site, read the explanation of why
   the order of growth of the running time of ThreeSum.count()
   is n^3.

6. Give the order of growth of 3a, 3b, and 3c.

7. Design a quadratic-time algorithm that, given an array of integers,
   finds a pair that are closest to each other.
   Write the program ClosestPair.java and modify the DoublingTest program
   to test your code.



Submit: The files: ClosestPair.java and DoublingTest.java.
        Include in the documentation of ClosestPair.java
        your answers to questions 3 and 6 as well as your names.
