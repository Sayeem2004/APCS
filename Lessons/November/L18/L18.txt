 ============================================================================
Task #1: Go over homework.
============================================================================
--- Peaks.java


---
   Suppose that a terrain is represented by a two-dimensional grid of
   elevation values (in meters). A peak is a grid point whose four
   neighboring cells (left, right, up, and down) have strictly lower
   elevation values. Write a program Peaks that reads from standard
   input and then computes and prints the number of peaks in the terrain.

   Create the file Terrains.txt that stores the elevation values.
   The first line will contain the dimensions of the grid.

   An example of Terrains.txt which stores a 4x5 grid.
   4 5
   1 2 3 6 1
   4 9 2 8 1
   7 8 9 4 5
   5 6 3 8 2

   Note: Only interior points may be peaks.



=============================================================================
Task #2: The StdDraw Library: Points.java
============================================================================
    ---  Download StdDraw.java

    ---  Together build the Points program.
          - The default canvas is a 1 x 1 square.
          - The origin is in the lower left corner.


      Write a program that takes an integer n from the command-line
      and draws n random points.

         - To draw a point, use the method.

               void static point(double x, double y)

         - You can send the points drawn to standard output.

         - The default pen size is 0.002.
         -   You can change the pen size with the method.

               Std.setPenRadius(double r)
            Add a second command-line argument r for the pen radius.

============================================================================
Task #3 : The Hello World program for graphics. (Triangle.java)
============================================================================
     - To draw a line:

        void static line(x0,y0,x1,y1)

       draws a line from (x0,y0) to (x1,y1).

     - Draw a equilateral Triangle with side length 1.
     - Place one point in the interior of the triangle.

     -- See the program Triangle.java

============================================================================
Task #4: Setting the scale  (NLines.java)
============================================================================
    --- Review the code for PlotFilter.java
        -- introduce double buffering


     - To set the scale of the x and y axes.

         static void setXscale(double min, double max)
         static void setYscale(double min, double max)

       (NLines.java)
     - Write a program that draws the n lines defined below:
        (0,n), (0,0)
        (0,n-1),(1,0)
        (0,n-2),(2,0)
        (0,n-3),(3,0)
        ...
        (0,0), (n,0)

==========================================================================
Task #5: Homework
==========================================================================
  1.  Exercise #26 : Circles.java
  2.  Web Exercise #12: Diamonds.java
  3.  Review the program FunctionGraph.java
      Complete Web exercise #10: TakagiFunction.java

   4. Reveiw Exercise #17: Checkerboard.java
      Complete Web exercise #14. BulgingSquares.java
