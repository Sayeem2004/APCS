This lab is based on the exercises found at:
  https://chortle.ccsu.edu/Java5/Notes/chap53B/progExercises53B.html

Examine the following Diamond class.


The size of a diamond is measured in carets, usually less than 5.0.
The clarity grade of a diamond is give as a two or three letter code,
FL, IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1, I2, I3. FL (flawless) is
the best, I3 is the worst. The color grade is a one letter code, D
through Z. D is the best, Z is the worst. The cut is the name of the
pattern the diamond has been cut into.

Finish the toString() and the compareTo() methods. Write compareTo()
so that diamonds are ordered first by caret, then by clarity OR color,
whichever is better for the particular diamond. Since there are 23 grades
of color, but only 11 grades of clarity, regard the first two color grades
as equal in grade to the first grade of clarity, the next two color grades
equal in grade to the second grade of clarity, and so on.
Write compareTo() so that better diamonds are to the left of poor diamonds.
This means that

     goodDiamond.compareTo( poorDiamond )

returns a negative value. Notice that large caret diamonds will appear
first on the list, the reverse of the usual order for numbers.

In comparing the codes for clarity, you will need a series of if statements.
It might be useful to write a separate compareClarity() method as part of

the class. Use the DiamondTester program to test your code.
