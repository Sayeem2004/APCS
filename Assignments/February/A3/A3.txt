--- Assignment #3 (Individual Assignment)------------------------------------
Extend the plot method of the FunctionGraph program so that it takes
a Color parameter, which controls the color of the line. Use this extended
plot method to create a graph showing the growth curves of the most common
complexity classes --- constant, logarithmic, linear, N log N, quadratic,
and exponential -- each in a different color. Use a lambda expression to define
each function.


-- FunctionGraph.java (Modifiy this program).
-- Function.java **** Use the exact version from the book site. ****
-- Only use classes found in stdlib.jar

The execution instructions for your program:

%java -cp .:../../stdlib.jar FunctionGraph 1 25 50

produces the picture : ComplexityGraph.png

Put your name in the documentation of FunctionGraph.java and submit only
this program.
