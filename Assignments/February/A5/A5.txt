Based on the exercises found here:

Examine the following Employee class.


Finish the toString(), equals(), and compareTo() method using all three of
the instance variables.
Access them using the getX() methods. Compare two employees by first looking
at their last names. If the names are different, return the value the String
method compareTo() returns with the last names. If the names are equal,
look at the first name and return the value the String method compareTo()
returns. If both parts of the name are equal, return the difference of the
birthYears so that the older employee precedes the younger employee.

Test your implementation using the EmployeeTester program.
