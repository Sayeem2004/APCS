Write a Java program to simulate an ecosystem containing two types of
creatures, bears and fish. The ecosystem consists of a river, which is
modeled as a relatively large array. Each cell of the array should contain
an Animal object, which can be a Bear object, a Fish object, or null. In
each time step, based on a random process, each animal either attempts to
move into an adjacent array cell or stay where it is. If two animals of
the same type are about to collide in the same cell, then they stay where
they are, but they create a new instance of that type of animal, which is
placed in a random empty (i.e., previously null) cell in the
array. If a bear and a fish collide, however, then the fish dies
(i.e., it disappears).

Use actual object creation, via the new operator, to model the creation of new
objects, and provide a visualization of the array after each time step.

Your submission must include the following files:
      - Animal.java
      - Bear.java
      - Fish.java
      - Simulator.java
      - Summary.pdf
