Assignment-04: (Group work)

Create an immutable and comparable data type to represent Postal Bar Codes.

A bar code is generated from a 5 digit zip code by representing each digit with
a combination of 3 half bars and 2 full bars. Note that leading 0's are allowed
for zip codes.

Represent a full bar with "|" and a half bar with ":".

To represent each of the 10 digits uniquely, the codes use a 7-4-2-1-0
positional placement scheme. A full bar turns on the value associated with
the position.

1  :::||
2  ::|:|
3  ::||:
4  :|::|
5  :|:|:
6  :||::
7  |:::|
8  |::|:
9  |:|::
0  ||:::   (special case)

A check digit is added to the right of a zip code. The check digit is equal
to the sum of the digits of the zip code modulo 10.

For example,
   if the zip code is : 08451
   then the check digit is : 8
   thus the zip + check digit is : 084518

A bar code has a 2 guard rails (full bars) that lead and end the code.

So the bar code of 084518 is:

 |||:::|::|::|::|:|:|::::|||::|:|



Implement the following constructors and methods.
