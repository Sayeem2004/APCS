In the subset-sum problem there are often several ways to generate the desired target
number. For example, given the set {1,3,4,5}, there are two different ways to produce
the target value 5; you can select the 1 and the 4 or, alternatively, select just the 5.
By contrast, there is no way to partition the set {1,3,4,5} to get 11.


In the SubsetSum program, write a method

  public static int subsetSumWays(TreeSet<Integer> set, int target)

that returns the number of ways in which you can produce the target value by choosing
a subset of the specified set. For example, suppose that sampleSet has been initialized
as follows:

           TreeSet<Integer> sampleSet = new TreeSet<Integer>();
	   sampleSet.add(1);
	   sampleSet.add(3);
	   sampleSet.add(4);
	   sampleSet.add(5);

Given this definition of sampleSet, calling

    subsetSumWays(sampleSet,5);

should return 2 (there are two ways to make 5),

and calling,

    subsetSumWays(sampleSet,11)

should return 0 (there are no ways to make 11).


Call the subsetSumWays() method in main.


Sample runs:

$ java -cp .:../stdlib.jar SubsetSum 1 3 4 5
enter target value: 5
set: [1, 3, 4, 5]
target: 5
subset exits? true
subset sum ways: 2

$ java -cp .:../stdlib.jar SubsetSum 1 3 4 5
enter target value: 11
set: [1, 3, 4, 5 ]
target: 11
subset exits? false
subset sum ways: 0
