===========================================================================
1. Watch the first 2 minutes of the video:

   MIT VIDEO ASYMPTOTIC NOTATION:
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWkh5kb4TGc


2. From the book site, read the explanation of why

     n^3/6 - n^2/2 + n/3 ~ n^3/6


3. Use the tilde notation to simplify

   a.  n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)/24
   b.  n(n+1) - n^2
   c.  n(n+1)/2 + nlog n
       Hint:
       https://socratic.org/questions/how-do-you-find-the-limit-of-ln-n-n-as-n-approaches-infinity

4. Watch minutes 5:15 - 6:45 of the MIT video.

5. From the book site, read the explanation of why
   the order of growth of the running time of ThreeSum.count()
   is n^3.

6. Give the order of growth of 3a, 3b, and 3c.

7. Design a quadratic-time algorithm that, given an array of integers,
   finds a pair that are closest to each other.
   Write the program ClosestPair.java and modify the DoublingTest program
   to test your code.



Submit: The files: ClosestPair.java and DoublingTest.java.
        Include in the documentation of ClosestPair.java
        your answers to questions 3 and 6 as well as your names.
