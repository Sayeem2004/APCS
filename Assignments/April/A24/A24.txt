Recursive Graphics-- Assignment-24
=========================================================================
 Here is the problem specification:

   https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/assignments/htree.html


 As a group:
------------------------------------------------------
  a. Complete Part 1, the program Htree.java.


  b.Computer animations. Our most important use of double buffering is to
    produce computer animations, where we create the illusion of motion by
    rapidly displaying static drawings. We can produce animations by repeating
    the following four steps:

       1. Clear the offscreen canvas.
       2. Draw objects on the offscreen
       3. Copy the offscreen canvas to the onscreen canvas.
       4. Wait for a short while.

     For an example, review the program BouncingBall.java

       https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/15inout/BouncingBall.java

  c. Write a program AnimatedHTree.java that animates the
     drawing of the H-tree.

  d. Next, rearrange the order of the recursive calls (and the
     base case), view the resulting animation, and explain
     each outcome.



  e. Submit the file: AnimatedHTree.java
     Include documentation that includes:
          - Your names
	  - Your answers to part (d).
