Assignment-27
======================================================================


    Run some experiments to determine how much time string operations
    take.

    Apply the scientific method to develop and validate a hypothesis
    of the running time for the string methods:
      1. length()
      2. charAt()
      3. toLowerCase()
      4. replace()
      5. compareTo()
      6. equals()
      7. startsWith()
      8. endsWith()
      9. indexOf()
     10. substring()

    For each string method, state a hypothesis, an explanation of
    the experiment and provide a set of predictions and observations
    which validate your hypothesis.



    The hypothesis should be expressed in terms of the commonly encountered
    order-of-growth classifications.

           description             function
	      constant                1
	      logarithmic            log n
	      linear                  n
	      linearithmic           n log n
	      quadratic               n^2
	      cubic                   n^3
	      exponential             2^n



Submit the file : TimeStrings.java
                  - include your names in the documentation
		  - For each experiment, write the results of the experiment
		    as a comment dircectly above the code for the experiment.

                 Example:
		/*  Experiment for: length
		 *  Hypothesis:
		 *  Experiment Description:
		 *  Predictions and observations:
		 *
		 *
		 */
