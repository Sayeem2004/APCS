Assignment-23: Individual Work
This is an individual assignment.

Write a program EmbeddedWords that finds all the English words that can be formed by
taking a some subset of letters in order from a given starting word. For example,
given the starting word "happy", you can certainly produce the words:

          "a", "ha", "hap", and "happy",

in which the letters appear consecutively. You can also produce the words:

         "hay" and "ay",

because those letters appear in "happy" in the correct left-to-right order.

You cannot, however, producee the words:

          "pa" or "pap"

because the letters-even though they appear int the word-don't appear in the correct
order.

A sample run of the program might look like this:

$java EmbeddedWords happy
The Embedded words are:
 a
 ap
 app
 ay
 h
 ha
 hap
 happy
 hay
 hp
 hy
 p
 pp
 y


Your program should use this lexicon to determine whether a sequence of characters
is or is not a word.
