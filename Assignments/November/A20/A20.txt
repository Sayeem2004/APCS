Hw: complete parts I - IV
===========================================================================
I.  From  Coursera, watch the week 5 video lectures:
        - Basic Concepts
	- Case Study: Digital Audio

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. On codingbat.com

    i. Change the Memo to:  period-lastName-firstName

       ex. If John Doe is in period 3, then the memo should
           be :
	          3-Doe-John

    ii. Complete any 5 function exercises of your choosing.
        (5 points)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. For the next class, be prepared to discuss and present solutions to the following
     questions:



     i. Add the method goo() to the FunctionDemo progam. The goo function
        justs unguardedly calls itself.
        What happens?

     ii. From the book site section 2.1, download Harmonic.java.
     	 Change StdOut to System.out.
   	 Modify the Harmonic program to produce the following trace.

   $ java Harmonic 1 2 4
   i = 0
   arg = 1
   harmonic(1)
        sum = 0.0
        sum = 1.0
        return 1.0
   value = 1.0
   i = 1
   arg = 2
   harmonic(2)
        sum = 0.0
        sum = 1.0
        sum = 1.5
        return 1.5
   value = 1.5
   i = 2
   arg = 4
   harmonic(4)
        sum = 0.0
        sum = 1.0
        sum = 1.5
        sum = 1.8333333333333333
        sum = 2.083333333333333
        return 2.083333333333333
   value = 2.083333333333333

IV. (5 points)
    Submit via Google Classroom Sqrt.java that contains one method
    sqrt(double) which implements the algorithm described below. You will not
    receive credit if your name is not in the documentation.

    To compute the square root of x, clients of your program will invoke the
    method by issuing the following statement:

          Sqrt.sqrt(x);






   Even though clients of the Math class typically don't need to understand
   how methods like sqrt work internally, the implementers of that library
   have to be able to design an effective algorithm and write the necessary
   code. If you were asked to implement the sqrt method without using the
   library version, there are many strategies you could adopt. One of the
   easiest strategies to understand is successive approximation, in which
   you make a guess at the solution and then refine that guess by choosing
   new values that move closer to the solution.

   You can use successive approximation to determine the square root of x
   by adopting the following strategy:

   1. Begin by guessing that the square root is x/2. Call that guess g.

   2. The actual square root must lie between g and x / g. At each step
      in the successive approximation, generate a new guess by averaging
      g and x / g.

   3. Repeat step 2 until the values g and x / g are as close together
      as the precision of the hardware allows. In Java, the best way to
      check for this condition is to test whether the average is equal
      to either of the vales used to generate it.

   Use this strategy to write your our implementation of the sqrt method.
