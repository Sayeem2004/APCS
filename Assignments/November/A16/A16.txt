Assignment-16
1. Review Stats.java from the lesson.txt.


2. Coursera watch the week4 lecture:

        Standard input and output video.

3. Section 1.4:

   Creative exercise #29: Hadamard Matrix
                     #41: BinomialDistribution.java


4. The mechanism depicted below - known as the "Galton board" - can
   be used to demonstrate important properties of a random process:


                                   /   *   \
                                 /   *   *   \
                               /   *   *   *   \
                             /   *   *   *   *   \
                           /   *   *   *   *   *   \
                         /   *   *   *   *   *   *   \
                       /   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   \
                     /   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   \
                   /   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   \
                   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                   -----------------------------------------

   The mechanism works as follows. You start by dropping a marble in the
   hole at the top. The marble falls down and hits the uppermost peg, indicated
   by the topmost asterisk in the diagram. The marble bounces off the
   peg and falls, with equal probability, to the left or right. Whichever
   way it goes, it then hits a peg on the second level and bounces again,
   one direction or the other. The process continues until the marble passes
   all the pegs and drops into one of the channels at the bottom. For example,
   the dotted line in the following diagram shows one possible path for the
   first marble:
                                       .
                                    .
                                       .
                                   /   *.  \
                                 /   *   * . \
                               /   *   * . *   \
                             /   *   *   * . *   \
                           /   *   *   *   * . *   \
                         /   *   *   *   *  .*   *   \
                       /   *   *   *   *  .*   *   *   \
                     /   *   *   *   *   * . *   *   *   \
                   /   *   *   *   *   * . *   *   *   *   \
                   |   |   |   |   |   | . |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   | . |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   | . |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   | . |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   | . |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   | . |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   | . |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   |   | O |   |   |   |   |

   Write a program that simulates the operation of dropping M marbles into a
   probability board with N channels along the bottom and k levels of pegs.
   The progam displays the number of marbles in each column. Part of the point
   of this exercise is to show that the columns near the center tend to get more
   marbles, as in the following diagram.

                                   /   *   \
                                 /   *   *   \
                               /   *   *   *   \
                             /   *   *   *   *   \
                           /   *   *   *   *   *   \
                         /   *   *   *   *   *   *   \
                       /   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   \
                     /   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   \
                   /   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   \
                   |   |   |   |   | 0 |   |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   | 0 |   |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   |   | 0 | 0 |   |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   |   |   |
                   |   |   |   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   |   |
                   |   |   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   |   |
                   |   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   |   |
                   | O | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   | 0 |
                   -----------------------------------------


    The printed output of dropping 35 marbles into the Galton board
    with 10 channels is:

    $ java Galton 35 10
