==========================================================================
The Josephus Problem (Classic Problem). (Individual Work)
==========================================================================



Josephus problem.
In the Josephus problem from antiquity, n people are in dire straits and
agree to the following strategy to reduce the population. They arrange
themselves in a circle (at positions numbered from 1 to n) and proceed
around the circle, eliminating every kth person until only one person is
left. Legend has it that Josephus figured out where to sit to avoid being
eliminated. Write a Queue client Josephus.java that takes two integer
command-line arguments n and k and prints the order in which people are
eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the circle).
