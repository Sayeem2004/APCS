   Morse Code (Group Assignment).

   Chart : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code
===================================================================================================

   Write a program that reads in lines from the user and translates each
   line either to or from Morse code, depending on the first character
   of the line:

   * If the line starts with -1 then terminate the program.

   * If the line starts with a letter, you want to translate it to Morse
     code. Any characters other than the 26 letters should simply be
     ignored.

   * If the line starts with a period (dot) or a hyphen (dash), it should
     read as a series of Morse code characters that you need to translate
     back to letters. You may assume that each sequence of dots and dashes
     in the input string will be separated by spaces, and you are free to
     ignore any other characters that appear. Because there is no encoding
     for the space between words, the characters of the translated
     message will be run together when your program translates in this
     direction.

   The program should end when the user enters -1. A sample run
   of this program might look like this:

   Morse code translator
   > SOS TITANTIC
     ... --- ... - .. - .--. .. -.-.
   > WE ARE SINKING FAST
    .-- . .- .-. . ... .. -. -.- .. -. --. ..-. .- ... -
   > .... . .- -.. .. -. --. ..-. --- .-. -.-- --- ..-
     HEADINGFORYOU
   > -1

   You must use a map data structure to store the letters and the
   Morse Code.

   Your program should read the morse codes from morse.txt.
