Assignment-18: Individual Work:  FindAreaCode.java
====================================================================================



Assignment-18:

  Telephone numbers in the United States and Canada are organized into various
  three-digit area codes. A single state or province often has many area codes,
  but a single area code never crosses a state or provincial boundary. This rule
  makes it possible to list the geographical locations of each area code in a date
  file. For this program, use In.java to access the data from the file:

              phone-na.csv
	      located here https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/data/phone-na.csv

  which contains the North American telephone codes.

  Use the AirportCodes program as a model, write the program FindAreaCode
  to read this file into Map<Integer,String>, where the key is the area code and
  the value is the location. Once you've read in the data, then repeatedly ask
  the user for an area code and then look up the corresponding location, as illustrated
  in the following sample run:

     $ java FindAreaCode
     Enter area code or state name: 650
     California
     Enter area code or state name: 202
     District of Columbia
     Enter area code or state name: 778
     British Columbia
     Enter area code or state name: -1


   When the user enters -1 your program must terminate.

   As the prompt suggests, however, your program should also allow users to
   enter the name of a state or province and have the program list all the area
   codes that serve that area, as illustrated by the following sample run:

   $ java FindAreaCode
   Enter area code or state name: Oregon
   503
   541
   971
   Enter area code or state name: -1


  Submit the file: FindAreaCode.java
                   Put your name in the documentation.
		   Your program must use In.java and the file phone-na.csv.
