Submit the file : CheckoutLineSimulator.java

Write a program that simulates a checkout line, such as one you might encounter
in a supermarket. Customers arrive at the checkout stand and get in
line. Those customers wait until the cashier is free, at which point
they occupy the cashier for some period of time. After the service time
is complete, the cashier is free to serve the next customer.

In each second, the simulation performs the following operations:

1. Determine whether a new customer has arrived. New customers arrive
randomly, with a probability given by the constant ARRIVAL_PROBABILITY.
The value of ARRIVAL_PROBABILITY is the first argument read from the
command-line.



2. If the cashier is busy with a customer, subtract one second from the time
remaining to service this customer. When that count reaches zero, the current
customer is finished.

3. If the cashier is free, serve the next customer. The service time
is uniformly distributed between MIN_SERVICE_TIME and MAX_SERVICE_TIME.

MIN_SERVICE_TIME is the second argument read from the command-line. Its
units is in seconds.

MAX_SERVICE_TIME is the third argument read from the command-lint. Its
units is in minutes.

4. Update the SIMULATION_TIME.
SIMULATION_TIME is the fourth command-line arguement. Its units is in
minutes.

At the end of the simulation, the program displays the simulation
parameters along with the results of the simulation.
