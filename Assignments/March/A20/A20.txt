=========================================================================
Task #5: RandomPhoneNumbers.java
=========================================================================

Write a program that takes a command line input N and prints N random
phone numbers of the form (xxx) xxx-xxxx. Use a symbol table to avoid
choosing the same number more than once.

Use this list of area codes

   https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/data/phone-na.csv

to avoid printing out bogus area codes.



===========================================================================
Task #6: UniqueSubstringsOfLengthL.java
===========================================================================
Write a program that reads in text from standard input and calculate the
number of unique substrings of length L that it contains. For example, if
the input is cgcgggcgcg then there are 5 unique substrings of length 3:
            cgc, cgg, gcg, ggc, and ggg.

Applications to data compression.

Hint: use the string method substring(i, i + L) to extract ith substring
and insert into an appropriate collection.
Test it out on the first million digits of pi

  https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/data/pi-1million.txt

or 10 million digits of pi
