Round Robin Schedulers
============================================================================

A popular use of a queue data structure is to implement a round robin
scheduler, where we iterate through a collection of elements in a
circular fashion and "service" each element by performing a given
action on it.

Such a schedule is used, to fairly allocate a resource that must be
shared by a collection of clients.

- allocate a slice of CPU time to various applications running
concurrently on a computer.


Implement a round robin scheduler using a queue, Q, by repeating
performing the following 3 steps

1. e <- Q.dequeue()
2. service element e
3. Q.enqueue(e)

Simulate the Hot Potato Game
============================
In this game, children form a circle then pass an object
around the circle. As the object is passed from one child to another,
an adult will randomly yell out "HOT POTATO". Upon which the child holding
the object is removed from the circle. The game continues with the next
child until there is one child remaining.

Use a Round Robin Scheduler to simulate the child's game Hot Potato.

From the command line, read the probability that "HOT POTATO" is
called.
