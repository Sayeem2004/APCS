3. Second modification, use the online sort detective to run
   your experiments.

4. The Write-Up

   You are to identify the mystery sorts and justify your conclusions.
   Your write-up should demonstrate an understanding of the sorting
   algorithms and should also identify how their differences are realized by
   your experiments. Please keep things low-key (i.e. no need for
   multi-color graphs with dozens of data points).  But you should write in
   clear English sentences and include a reasonable amount of detail. If your
   experiments are well chosen, your write-up can still be pretty short.

   One write up per group.
   Put your names in the document.
