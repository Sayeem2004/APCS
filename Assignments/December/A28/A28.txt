=========================================================================
 String Processing Exercises:
=========================================================================

1. Suppose that you have declared and initialized the variable s as follows:

      String s = "hello, world";

   Given that declaration, what is the value of each of the following calls:

                      h e l l o ,   w o r  l  d
                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

   a. s + "!"         --> "hello, world!"

   b. s.length()      --> 12

   c. s.charAt(5)     --> ','

   d. s.indexOf('l')   --> 2

   e. s.indexOf("l",5);  --> 10

   f. s.replace('h','3') -> "3ello, world"

   g. s.substring(0,3)    -> "hel"

   h. s.substring(7)        -> "world"

   i. s.substring(3,5)      -> "lo"

   j. s.substring(3,3)      -> ""



2. Write the free standing methond secondHalf(String) that returns the
   second half of the parameter str, which is defined to include the
   middle character if the length of str is odd:


      public static String secondHalf(String str){
      	     // Your Code Goes Here
      }


3. Given the format for a file name : base.extension

   For example,   hw.txt
               base      is hw
	       extension is txt

   Write a code fragment to extract the file name and extension from
   a command-line argument.

        String s = args[0];



4. What does the following code fragment print?

   String string1 = "hello";
   String string2 = string1;
   string1 = "world";
   System.out.println(string1);
   System.out.println(string2);


5. What does the following code fragement print?

   String s = "Hello World";
   s.toUpperCase();
   s.substring(6,11);
   System.out.println(s);

6. Write the free standing method topLevelDomain(String) that
   takes a string that represents a domain name, returns its
   top-level domain. For example, the top-level domain
   of the string cs.princeton.edu is edu.

   public static String topLevelDomain(String domainName){
   	  // your code goes here

   }


7. Write a static method that takes a domain name as its argument
   an returns the reverse domain name (reverse the order of the strings
   between periods). For example, the reverse domain name of cs.princeton.edu
   is edu.princeton.cs. This computation is useful for web log analysis.


8. A string s is a circular shift of a string t if it matches when the
   characters of one string are circularly shifted by some number of positions.
   For example, "ACTGACG" is a circular shift of "TGACGAC", and vice versa.
   Detecting this condition is important in the study of genomic sequences.
   Write a program that checks whether two given strings s and t are circular
   shifts of one another. Hint:  The solution is a one-liner with indexOf()
   and concatenation.

AP STRING METHODS YOU NEED TO KNOW
=========================================================================

   1. int length() -> returns the length of a string.

   2. String substring(int from, int to) -> returns a substring of the
                                            receiver starting at index
                                            from upto but not including
                                            the character at index to.

       ex. "chicken".substring(2,5) -> "ick"

       A substring is a consecutive subsequence of a string.

   3. String substring(int from)  -> is equivalent to substring(from,length())


   4. int indexOf(String str) -> returns the index of the first occurrence
                                 of str; -1 if str is not found.

       ex. "chicken".indexOf("ick") -> 2
           "chicken".indexOf("ci")  -> -1

   5. boolean equals(String str) -> returns true if the receiver is equivalent
                                     to str; false otherwise.

   6. int compareTo(String str) -> returns 0 when equal
                                   returns 1 when receiver is larger
				   returns -1 when receiver is smaller
