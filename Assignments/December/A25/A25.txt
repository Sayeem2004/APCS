I. Review the programs:

       - EuclidPiEstimate.java
       - Lame.java
       - WrapperEx.java


II. Submit the RiffleShuffle.java and ChromaticScale.java
    programs. On or before Monday 12/07.


III. Be prepared to present your solution to  the Titius-Bode problem.
     You may work with a partner.



   In the 18th century, the astronomer Johann Daniel Titius proposed a rule,
   later recorded by Johann Elert Bode, for calculating the distance from
   the sun to each of the planets known at the time. To apply that rule,
   which is know as the "Titius-Bode-Law", you begin by writing down the
   sequence

        b_1 = 1    b_2 = 3   b_3 = 6  b_4 = 12   b_5 = 24   b_6 = 48 ...

   where each subsequent element in the sequence is twice the preceding one.
   It turns out that an approximate distance to the ith planet can be computed
   from this series by applying the formula


      d_i = 4 + b_i
           ---------
              10


    The distance d_i is expressed in astronomical units (AUs), which correspond
    to the average distance from the earth to the sun (approximately 93E6 miles).
    Except for a disconcerting gap between Mars and Jupiter, the "Titius-Bode" law
    gives reasonable approximations for the distances to the seven planets known
    at the time.


           Mercury      0.5AU
           Venus        0.7AU
           Earth        1.0AU
           Mars         1.6AU
           ?            2.8AU
           Jupiter      5.2AU
           Saturn       10.0AU
           Uranus       19.6AU

    Concern about the gap in the sequence led astronomers to discover the asteroid
    belt, which they suggested might have been the remains of a planet that had
    once orbited the sun at the distance specified by the missing entry in the
    table.

    Write a recursive method getTitiusBodeDistance(k) that calculates the expected
    distance between the sun and the kth planet, numbering outward from Mercury
    starting at 1. Test your method by writing a program that displays the
    distances to each of these planets in tabular form.
