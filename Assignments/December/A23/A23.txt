Complete tasks #1 - #3 for the next class.





===========================================================================
Task #1: Review Functions.java
===========================================================================

============================================================================
Task #2: Cannonballs
=============================================================================

 a.Spherical objects, such as cannonballs, can be stacked to form a pyramid
   with one cannonball at the top, sitting on top of a square composed of
   four cannonballs, sitting on top of a square composed of nine cannonballs,
   and so forth. Write a recursive method cannonball that takes as its
   argument the height of the pyramid and returns the number of cannonballs
   it contains. Your method must operate recursively and must not use any
   iterative constructs such as while or for.

 b. Write a program Cannonball.java that takes one command-line argument n
    and uses the recursive function from part(a) to print the height of the
    pyramid. Throw a run time exception when necessary.


 c. Draw a stack frame diagram for cannonball(3).



===============================================================================
Task #3: ToBinary
===============================================================================

  Write a program that takes a positive integer n (in decimal) as a
  command-line argument and prints its binary representation. Use this simple
  method: repeatedly divide 2 into n and read the remainders backward.

  a. First write a function toReverseBinary(int) that uses a while loop to
     carry out this computation and returns a String with the bits in the
     wrong order.

  b. Then write a function toBinary(int) that uses recursion to arrange the bits
     in the correct order.

Hw: Due Friday
================================================================================

1. Compose a program to rearrange a deck of n cards using the
   Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds model of a "riffle-shuffle." First, generate
   a random integer r according to a binomial distribution: flip a fair
   coin n times and let r be the number of heads. Now, divide the deck
   into two piles: the first r cards and the remaining n-r cards. To
   complete the shuffle, repeatedly take the top card from one of the
   two piles and put it on the bottom of a new pile. If there are n1 cards
   remaining in the first pile and n2 cards remaining in the second pile,
   choose the next card from the first pile with probability n1 / (n1 + n2)
   and from the second pile with probability n2 / (n1 + n2).

   Watch this video :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxJubaijQbI
   to determine how many riffle shuffles you need to apply to a deck
   of 52 cards to produce a (nearly) uniformly shuffled deck.

   Write the program RiffleShuffle.java to demonstrate the result. Represent
   the 52 cards in an integer array(card[0], ... ,card[51) and your program
   should include a method riffleShuffe(int [] cards) that performs
   exactly 1 riffle shuffle via a side effect.

   Look up the bernoulli() method from the StdRandom library and use it
   in your program.


2. Write the program ChromaticScale.java that plays each note, starting with A,
   in the chromatic scale for 1 second.
      -- Use the StdAudio library
