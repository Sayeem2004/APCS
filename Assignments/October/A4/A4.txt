	         Distinct.java
		 RGBtoCMYK.java
	 -- Include documentation in your source code.
	 -- Remove any package declarations.

======================================================================================

1. Review the documentation for Java operators :

     https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html

2. Read section 1.3 : Conditionals and Loops at least up to the if statement.

3. Review the code Flip.java from section 1.3.

4. Watch Lecture 2A: Conditionals the if statement

5. From section 1.3: try exercise 1. (AllEqual.java).

6. From section 1.3: try exercise 6. (RollLoadedDie.java).

7. Write a program, Distinct.java, that takes three integer command-line arguments
   a, b, and c and print the number of distinct values (1, 2, or 3) among a, b, and c.

8. Practice Type conversion.

   There are a number of different formats for representing color.
   RGB format specifies the level of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) on an integer scale
   from 0 to 255: It is the primary format for LCD displays, digital cameras, and web pages.

   CMYK format specifies the level of cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K) on a
   real scale of 0.0 to 1.0: It is the primary format for publishing books and magazines.
   Write a program RGBtoCMYK.java that reads in three integers red, green, and blue from the
   command line and prints out equivalent CMYK parameters. The mathematical formulas for
   converting from RGB to an equivalent CMYK color are:

       white = max{red/255, green/255, blue/255}
       cyan  = (white - red/255) / white
       magenta = (white - green/255) / white
       yellow = (white - blue/255) / white
       black = (1 - white)

   Hint. Math.max(x, y) returns the maximum of x and y.

    % java RGBtoCMYK 75 0 130       // indigo
      cyan    = 0.423076923076923
      magenta = 1.0
      yellow  = 0.0
      black   = 0.4901960784313726

    If all three red, green, and blue values are 0, the resulting color is black (0 0 0 1).
