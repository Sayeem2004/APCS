Due Oct 21
1. Enroll in the Coursera course: Computer Science: Programming with
   a purpose.  (It is free).


2. From this course, watch the following lectures from week 3:

     - Basic Concepts (16 min)
     - Typical array-processing code (23 min).


3. Don't sumbit your solutions, but complete these exercise before the start of the next class.

    Question #1:

        Draw the state of a[] after each statement that modifies a[].

          int n = 10;
	  int [] a = new int[10];
	  a[0] = 1;
	  a[1] = 2;
	  for (int i = 2 ; i < n; i++)
	       a[i] = a[i-1] + a[i - 2];


  Question #2:

           What does the following code fragment print?

           int [] a = {1,2,3};
	   int [] b = {1,2,3};
	   System.out.println(a == b);


  Question #3:

            Write a program HowMany that takes a variable number of command-line
	    arguments and prints how many there are.


  Question #4:

            Write a program DiscreteDistribution that takes a variable number of
	    integer command-line arguments and prints the integer i with probability
	    proportional to the ith command-line argument.

	    Sample runs:
    	    // six equally likely events
   	    $ java DiscreteDistribution 1 1 1 1 1 1
   	    3

 	    $ java DiscreteDistribution 1 1 1 1 1 1
            0

            // six events, one 3x more likely than the others
            $ java DiscreteDistribution 1 1 1 1 1 3
            5

            $ java DiscreteDistribution 1 1 1 1 1 3
            2

            $ java DiscreteDistribution 1 1 1 1 1 3
            5
