1. Complete the AP Unit test.

2. Watch the Princeton lectures:
        2c An alternative: the for loop
	2D Nesting


3.Suppose a, b, and c are random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
  What is the probability that a, b, and c form the side length of some
  triangle? Hint: they will form a triangle if and only if the sum of every
  two values is larger than the third.

  Write the program TriangleProbability that uses a Monte Carlo Simulation to
  determine the answer.

  Use Math.random() to generate the uniformly distributed random values
  between 0 and 1.

Is the AP Unit test the "Unit 1 Progress Check: MCQ Part B" assignment?
